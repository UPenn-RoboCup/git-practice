This is a dummy repository for practicing merging and resolving conflicts

You should fork this directory, merge the branches "documentation" and
"functionality" into "master", and then push your changes to your own github
account. What you will submit is a link to the repository on your github
account. Make sure the project is public!

You will need to resolve merge conflicts for this assignment. When you are
finished, go ahead and execute the following.

>test/lunit test.lua

All tests should pass.
